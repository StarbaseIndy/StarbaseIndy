This fierce conflict between two ‚Äústand-ins‚Äù of iconic franchises might even justify popcorn.\n\nThe film will and has used AI in various ways. More accurate lip syncing and facial capture was achieved with the help of artificial intelligent models. Furthermore, AI helped with translation and full dubbing into twelve languages. \n\nAlthough the film is animated and highly technical it comes across as old. With the black and white appearance and 5:4 aspect ratio there was a very deliberate intention to come across as an old war film.
