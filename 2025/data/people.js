By Highschool he was making a comic series. After college he made a motion-comic that showed in film festivals. The success gave him the courage to build and operate a small film studio in San Francisco. Although one of his first clients was an Oscar nominated actress, Huston only kept the studio open for roughly a year. The choice to close the studio was as much a creative choice as it was a medical one. An epilepsy condition he had since 23 became more serious quickly after having a seizure while driving. The seizures grew in number and severity till they were causing brain damage. Huston intermittently lost speech and movement for long periods of time. Fighting to live was not enough.
