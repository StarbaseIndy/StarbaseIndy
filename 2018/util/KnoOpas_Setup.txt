Notes for setting up KonOpas:

If you're using github static web page hosting to serve your content:
1. Register an account at github.com (if you haven't already)
2. Also register an account with shared organization credentials at github.com
3. Use your organization credentials to create a new repository
4. Navigate to Repository -> Settings -> Collaborators and add all contributors via username.
5. On the main Repository page, click on the "Clone or Download" button to copy the https URL for the repository
1. Download the git client from https://git-scm.com/downloads (Windows/Mac/Linux)
2. Install the git client (follow instructions on the download page and installer)
3. Configure the git client with YOUR credentials (not the organization credentials)
4. Clone the repo using the https URL copied from step 5.  Note the local folder to which the repository was cloned.


Configure PHP on your system:
1. Download PHP 7.1 
1a Windows: 
   Download from: from http://windows.php.net/download
   unzip to c:\php
   Copy php.ini-development to php.ini
1b: Mac: 
   Follow installation instructions
   Run this command to find the "Loaded Configuratoin File": /usr/local/php5/bin/php --ini
2. Edit php.ini
   Uncomment: extension=php_openssl.dll
   Uncomment: extension_dir = "ext"
   Change line: 
     from: error_reporting = E_ALL
	 to:   error_reporting = E_ALL ^ E_DEPRECATED
3. Open command prompt / terminal in the project util folder (under the folder to which the repository was cloned, if you're using github)
4. Run: c:\php\php.exe read-from-gdrive.php
4a. Windows: c:\php\php.exe read-from-gdrive.php
4b. Mac: /usr/local/php5/bin/php read-from-gdrive.php

   You should see three "... ok." messages and then an "All done." messages
   This shows that your system is now configured properly to run the script.
