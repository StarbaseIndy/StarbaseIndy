Somehow, serious flaws in architecture and engineering were not caught until the prototype ship was completed. From its launch, it has been plagued with mechanical and operational problems that have played havoc with its fitness and combat-readiness, to the point where it became the butt of jokes throughout Starfleet.\n\nSoon it had become a dumping ground for personnel who were considered too disruptive or incompetent for front-line service, but who had not done anything sufficiently egregious to warrant being discharged. Eventually, Starfleet Command sent down an order to retire the embarrassing vessel, to the relief of all involved. But it was not to be. At the last moment, the Federation Council countermanded the directive: a political use had been found for the vessel.

In the popular films Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, John appeared in various roles and earned himself a place in the hearts of fans all over the nation. \nDiscovered at ACT for film by Robert Altman, the director featured him as Captain Walter Kosciuszko \"Painless Pole\" Waldowski in M*A*S*H (1970). As Painless, Schuck holds a place in Hollywood history as the first person to utter the word \"f*ck[ing]\" in a major studio film. He went on to work with Altman in Brewster McCloud, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, and Thieves Like Us, where he played a bank robber on the lam.\n\nHe has played several lovable lugs including a robot in Holmes and Yoyo and as Herman Munster on The Munsters Today in the 80s. More challenging guest role work has come to him through his work in Roots, Blade, Just You and Me, Kid, Earthbound, Finders Keepers, Outrageous Fortune, The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking, My Mom’s a Werewolf, and Dick Tracy.\n\nThe musical stage also took a shine to him. An accomplished singer, John appeared semi-regularly ( as the bald-domed, gruff-speaking Oliver \"Daddy\" Warbucks in the hit musical Annie, not only on Broadway but on tours and in smaller theater venues. He also garnered success playing Frank Butler in Annie Get Your Gun with Bernadette Peters on tour. Other roles over time have included the musicals The Sound of Music, Peter Pan, The Most Happy Fella and She Loves Me. He co-starred in the original premiere of Grumpy Old Men in 2011 and then returned to Broadway in 2013 as a replacement in the Gershwin musical Nice Work If You Can Get It.\n\nMore recently, on TV John played a police captain on an episode of Diagnosis Murder, had a recurring role as a Chief of Detectives in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit , and had another recurring role as shop keeper Carl in the skateboarding adventure series Zeke and Luther. He also appeared in the films Closer to God and All Light Will End.","name":["John","Schuck"],"links":{"img":"https://starbaseindy.github.io/StarbaseIndy/2023/images/JohnSchuck.jpg"},"prog":["57","58"]},{"id":"47","bio":"Ankur Gupta is a Full Professor and Chair of the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Butler University in Indianapolis, USA.
