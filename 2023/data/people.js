Somehow, serious flaws in architecture and engineering were not caught until the prototype ship was completed.

Eventually, Starfleet Command sent down an order to retire the embarrassing vessel, to the relief of all involved. But it was not to be. At the last moment, the Federation Council countermanded the directive: a political use had been found for the vessel.
