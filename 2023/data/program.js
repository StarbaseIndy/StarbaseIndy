Or are utopias for some inevitably created out of suffering for others?\nThe word Protopia refers to a vision of of the future in which today is better than yesterday, at least a little bit. In the article coining the word, futurist Kevin Kelly asks us to name a single science fiction future that is both plausible and desirable. Is Star Trek that example?
