            Arthur Conan Doyle's character, Sherlock Holmes, was the first
            fictional detective to explicitly base his solutions of cases on
            observation, science, and deductive reasoning. Many of the stories
            include accounts of Holmes' detailed examinations of crime scenes
            and pieces of evidence. David Zauner, a member of the Indianapolis
            Sherlock Holmes society, The Illustrious Clients, and a retired
            forensic scientist, will explore how the Holmes stories reflect
            applications of scientific principles to criminal investigations in
            the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and how forensic

            One might wonder what one of the most intellectual and influential

            a colorful, animated children's program populated with a character
            cast of tiny equines. Well, today's panel will include a discussion
            of the many similarities between the most recent version of <i>My
              Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i> and the many series of <i>Star
              Trek</i> in regards to aspects such as themes, character
            development, and script writing. We will also cover the similarities
            between the fandoms and the user-generated content these two shows
            inspire fans to create. Joining us as experts on creative content in
            both the Trek and MLP fandoms are several members of the Shake-ups

            <br>
            After several years of running the Partying Safely panel at
            conventions, Lisa realized that the ability to manage one's own
            boundaries is the foundational element of staying safe. Whether it's
            consenting to physical touch or consenting to that next alcoholic
            drink, the principles involved (and the skills required to do it
            effectively) remain the same. Consent is a popular topic of
            discussion, and there's some reason to believe it's not well
            understood throughout popular culture. Physical touch provides an
            excellent workshop tool for practicing how to give, deny, and revoke
            consent - and how to manage your feelings when others do those
            things in relation to you. We'll take a very "training wheels"
            approach in the session, and then those who consent will have some
            time to cuddle with each other.</td>

            <br>
            A Buddhist mantra says "breathing in I see myself as space/breathing
            out I feel free." Dr. Weaver expand on that idea by imagining
            "space" as inviting adventure both exhilarating and sometimes
            frightening or mysterious. She will explore the concept of the inner
            journey as it evolves in Trek, a drama about outer space. Trek's
            variations on the concept of journey suggests that it is closer to
            the dynamic possibilities of religious mystery than traditional
            doctrine and practice . Think about this line from an 8th century
            text about a relationship with the divine: "Thou are the journey and
            the journey's end." Then remember Trek episodes that take us to the
            end of time or space or explainable reality.</td>
