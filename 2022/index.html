<h2>COVID-19 Policy</h2>
<div>
<p>Starbase Indy is a convention based on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. Furthermore, the mission of SBI is to celebrate Star Trek's vision of the future by promoting humanitarianism and STEM education today. We believe that the best way to promote the wellbeing of all of humanity is to follow the science in keeping people healthy. To this effort, it has been decided that <b>All attendees must be vaccinated against COVID-19</b> in order to attend the convention if a vaccine is approved for their age group in time to be vaccinated. <b>Please complete and upload <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDS5NAYdFnGMf9Vsf8KfQkit2ipwkdrv-XoOiN_U1trS8IfA/viewform">via this form</a> proof of vaccination.</b>
<p>At the time of the writing of this initial policy (September 1, 2021), children under the age of 12 cannot be vaccinated. However, if an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) or authorization is made for additional age groups, this policy will be updated to reflect the current science and guidance of those authorizations.
<p><b>MANDATORY:</b> Proof of completed COVID-19 vaccination.
<p>Regardless of which vaccine you have chosen to receive, you should have been given a vaccination card. Completed Vaccination means that you have obtained the maximum number of injections required by your vaccine choice by November 15, 2021. This will allow for the minimum number of days after injection before your vaccination is fully effective. 
<p></b>Please complete and upload <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDS5NAYdFnGMf9Vsf8KfQkit2ipwkdrv-XoOiN_U1trS8IfA/viewform">via this form</a> proof of vaccination.</b> If you are not able to do this, you will need to bring your vaccination card or an image of it to registration at the time of badge pick up. 
<p><b>MANDATORY:</b> Proper wearing of approved mask in all convention spaces
<p>Appropriate facial coverings (aka masks) must be worn by all attendees over 2 years of age in all convention spaces, this includes the hallways, breakout rooms and the vendor hall. Gaiters, bandanas, and face shields are not considered appropriate facial coverings. Free masks will be provided at several locations around the convention. SBI logo masks will be available for sale at Registration for $5 and available for pre-purchase via the website. Masks must be worn covering the nose and mouth at all times. Masks should fit snugly and not have holes or vents. They must be worn covering your mouth and nose. See the CDC's guidelines for recommendations on masks. 
<p>Per the CDC, most people with underlying medical conditions can safely wear a mask. As such, we are highly unlikely to consider a medical exemption.
<p><b>Enforcement:</b> Staff will be trained to watch for appropriate use of masks. If an attendee is found to not be wearing a mask or wearing it inappropriately, Staff will give a verbal warning and will punch a hole in the badge of this person. If a second infraction occurs, Staff will inform the attendee that they must leave the convention space, punch a second hole, and confiscate the badge. The badge will be turned into Operations and the person will not be allowed to purchase a new badge. Two (2) holes in the badge will be equivalent to no badge at all. 
<p><b>Refund Policy:</b> Badges purchased prior to the announcement of this vaccination requirement (September 1, 2021) can be refunded or rolled over by emailing <a href="mailto:conchair@starbaseindy.org">conchair@starbaseindy.org</a> with the names of those wishing to be refunded. 
<p>We do ask that anyone feeling ill at the time of the convention refrain from attending. This does not require a positive COVID-19 test. If you are sick with COVID-19, a cold, the flu, *insert illness here*, please refrain from attending. Please email <a href="mailto:conchair@starbaseindy.org">conchair@starbaseindy.org</a> to obtain your refund and arrange for any purchased shirts, etc, to be obtained.
