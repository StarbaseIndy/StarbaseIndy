<h2>2022 Infectious Disease Policy</h2>
<div>
  <p>Starbase Indy is not just a convention, it is our chosen family. As such, we believe we have a duty to protect each other, and the families, friends, and communities we will return to after our Geek Family Thanksgiving concludes.

  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Convention participants: All attendee groups, including but not limited to exhibitors, guests, staff, press, professionals, volunteers, and cosplayers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>All convention participants be up-to-date on their COVID-19 initial vaccination and boosters as recommended by your country of origin.  Starbase Indy will not review individual attendee vaccination status for the 2022 convention.</li>
  <li>Any convention participant who feels unwell should avoid the convention.   Contact registration@starbaseindy.org to request a refund or a roll-over of badge(s) to next year.</li>
  <li>All convention participants practice frequent and thorough handwashing.  Note that Monkeypox is transmitted via contact with a contagious individual or objects that have come in contact with a contagious individual.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mandatory</h3>
  <p>All convention participants shall properly wear an approved mask in all convention spaces.
  <p>Approved facial coverings (aka masks) must be worn by all attendees over 5 years of age in all convention spaces: this includes the main stage area, vendor hall, programming areas, special event areas (e.g. gaming, bridge simulator, escape room), registration, operations, and security.  Masks must cover the nose and mouth. Masks must fit snugly and provide two-way air filtration.  Masks must not have holes, gaps, or exhalation valves/vents. Approved masks will be available at Registration at no cost.
  <p>Per the CDC, a mask must fit snugly against your face without gaps and without exhalation valves or vents. Mesh masks are not allowed.
  <p>Examples of APPROVED facial coverings:
  <ul>
    <li>Surgical masks</li>
    <li>N95 and KN95 masks</li>
    <li>Other masks with a bi-directional 95% filtration rate of 0.3 micron particles (e.g. HEPA)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, MicroClimate helmets meet this criteria</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Masks provided by Starbase Indy personnel</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examples of UNapproved facial coverings:
    <ul>
      <li>Facial coverings such as Gaiters, crochet masks, or fabric masks without a filter</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These do not provide proper bi-directional air filtration</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Any mask/respirator which includes an exhalation valve or vent</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These do not provide proper bi-directional air filtration</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Bandanas</li> 
      <ul>
        <li>These do not provide a proper snug fit</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Face shields</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These do not provide any air filtration</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  <p>Note that convention participants may wear whatever they’d like in addition to an approved facial covering.  For example, a face shield is perfectly acceptable when worn with an approved mask.
  <p>We encourage convention participants to read <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html">the CDC’s rationale for these types of masks</a>.

  <h3>Exceptions</h3>
  <p>Convention participants are free to forgo their masks in the following circumstances:
  <ul>
    <li>When not in convention space, which includes the Hotel restaurant, Hotel atrium, and the privacy of their own hotel room.  We do ask that all convention participants be respectful of those around them, wear a mask if/when asked, and practice social distancing.</li>
    <li>While actively consuming food or beverage.  We do ask that convention participants wear their mask during long pauses between bites or sips.  Alternatively, convention participants may choose to dine outside of convention space (see above).</li>
    <li>Main stage guests, entertainers, performers, and panel presenters may remove their mask while actively speaking, performing, or presenting for an event.  We do ask that all convention participants wear their masks at all other times while interacting with each other.</li>
    <li>Convention participants may briefly remove their mask while posing for photographs and selfies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In a nutshell, we’re asking convention participants to maximize the amount of time that they wear their mask while in convention space.  We truly believe that approved masks, worn properly, will significantly reduce (if not prevent) the spread of COVID-19.

  <h3>Enforcement</h3> 
  <p>Starbase Indy Security personnel shall be the final arbiter of what is accepted as an approved mask, and whether convention participants are compliant with this policy.
  <p>Staff will invite convention participants to wear their mask properly when they are found to be out of compliance with this policy.  Repeat offenders, at the discretion of Security personnel, will be directed to leave the convention space without possibility of refund or re-entry.
  <p>Security personnel may, at their discretion, remove convention participants from convention spaces who appear to be ill. 

  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <p>Partial or full refund for any badge type will be issued, at the discretion of the convention chair, in any of the following circumstances:
  <ul>
    <li>Unwillingness to comply with this policy is communicated to us before October 21st</li>
    <li>Becoming ill immediately before or during the convention</li>
    <li>Positive COVID-19 test result immediately before or during the convention</li>
    <li>A shift in Marion county health department mandates which would represent a significant shift in the requirements imposed on convention participants</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:conchair@starbaseindy.org">conchair@starbaseindy.org</a> to request a refund.
</div>

<!-- <h2>StarbaseIndy Protocols</h2> -->

  <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
  <p>This code of conduct applies to any individuals interacting within our virtual spaces or live events.

Starbase Indy reserves the right to revoke, without refund, the membership and badge of any attendee not in compliance with this policy. Persons finding themselves in a situation where they feel their safety is at risk or who become aware of an attendee not in compliance with this policy should immediately locate the nearest Staff member or Security personnel, so that the matter can be handled quickly and safely.

    <li>Actors and guests are people too; please don't harass them, and be respectful, especially when they are away from their autograph table. Everyone deserves some down time.</li>

His favorite genres to read and write are science fiction, speculative fiction, and thrillers. More than anything, he enjoys writing strange stories about strange characters in strange situations. Some people refer to him as a lucid dreaming expert. Others know him as a rapper. But E. S. Fein just thinks of himself as a dude who likes to think about what it means to be a dude thinking about being a dude. When he isn't hanging out with his partner and son, you can usually find him reading, playing DnD with his friends, going for walks while writing stories in his head before putting them on paper, or practicing yoga.

    <p>Pooker's Fairy Baubles came to be at a time when the kids were transitioning out of high school. I found time on my hands and started tinkering to see if I could make those things I had seen on a costume at a convention, or at a ren fest. All our wire art is 100% made by us (me), along with all the resin and shrink plastic pieces, I also create all the crochet items we sell as well. What started as a hobby has become a love of creating and challenging myself to see what I can do.<br/>
      We vend at some fan run conventions and on our new website. We recently started selling under the name of Creations by PFB, on Square Space. We are trying to phase out of the Etsy Store (Creations by PFB), but no worries, all that love and know us as Pooker's Fairy Baubles will still find use with the same web address:
