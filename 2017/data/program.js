Some recent work has been completed at Indiana University to provided VR system developers with a tool to help extend VR computers for electronic control of physical devices. This tool is named cy.PIPES. What this new innovation allows for is the easy construction of environmental feedback within a VR system. Developers need only to connect common house fans arranged around a VR space to simulate wind conditions. Similarly this could be done with heat lamps for heat feedback. Supporting olfactory (smell) feedback is also possible with common pieces and parts found at a hardware store.
